# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📊 Project Description

This project analyzes COVID-19 data from multiple countries to understand the trends in cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts over time. It uses Python libraries to load, clean, explore, and visualize the data from the Our World in Data dataset.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and explore COVID-19 global dataset
- Clean and filter the data for selected countries
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize cases, deaths, and vaccination progress
- Optional: Plot a choropleth map of global case distribution
- Derive insights and summarize findings

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly.express
